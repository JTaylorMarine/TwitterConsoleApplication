# TwitterConsoleApplication
A simple imitating twitter poster to local storage. The application stores the tweets to a local text file. This was my first project using C# to learn the different syntax and to help learn the basis of C# programming. 

In the future I would like to change this to actually implicating the Twitter API to embed on a web application and to maybe store the tweets on a database etc....
